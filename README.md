Hi!
I used a regular basic table + react + scss for styling (spent about 4-5 hours).

Often, I use libraries like Material or Ant Design, they are perfectly customizable and manageable.

As an option, I can rewrite to one of the ready-made options + add TypeScript.

I can also provide variants of tables from already realized my commercial projects.

About pictures, I also implemented their loading on different screen displays, although in the table (on figma) they do not change.
The only thing I want to clarify about helpers.jsx, I left the jsx in the file, although I know that it is better to split it into several sub-components.
